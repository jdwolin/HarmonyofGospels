  "articleBody": "= UNIT ONE: \"I came forth from the Father...\" (John 16:28a) I. \"The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. . .\" + (The first advent of Jesus: His birth, infancy, and boyhood) . The birth of the forerunner, John the Baptist\n+\nNote The ministry of a divinely appointed forerunner, to come in the spirit and power of Elijah, had been clearly prophesied in the OT, and the Jews eagerly awaited the appearance of this herald.\nThree primary passages foretelling such a forerunner:\nIsa 40:3-5\nMalachi 3:1\nMalachi 4:5-6\n+\nTip How might prophecies such as these color the thinking and attitude of the Jewish people living in AD C1?\n+\nThe announcement of the birth of John (Lk 1:5-25) Caution Harmony Event #1 Concerning the parents of John (Lk 1:5-7)\nJohn was born in the latter days of King Herod (Lk 1:5a)\n\"Herod was not only an Idumean in race and a Jew in religion, but he was a heathen in practice and a monster in character. During his administration as king he evidenced himself to be exceedingly crafty, jealous, cruel, and revengeful. He exercised his kingly power with the disposition of a very despot.\"\n— Unger Bible Dictionary John’s father, Zacharias, was a priest (Lk 1:5b)\nNote Concerning the arrangement of the priests in the days of Jesus:\nThe tribe of Levi was granted the priestly office (Dt 33:11). All the sons of Levi were to be workers in the temple, but only one family – the sons of Aaron – were to function in the tabernacle/temple as priests, ministering in the Levitical rituals.\nConcerning the historic lineage of the priestly family:\nTwo of Aaron’s sons were devoured for idolatry (Num 10:1-7); from his 2 surviving sons (Eleazar \u0026 Ithamar) had come 24 families; David, denied the privilege of building a temple for King Yahweh, spent the final years of his life arranging the temple services and personnel, including distributing the temple duties among these families.\nWhen Israel returned from Babylon, the priests had divided themselves into 24 orders; they alternated in performing the priestly office at Jerusalem, functioning in that capacity approximately twice a year. The balance of the year they lived in locations scattered around the land (reminiscent of the 48 “priestly cities” of the OT theocracy).\nThe reproach of John’s parents—​they were childless (Lk 1:7).\n\"Such a household as that of Zacharias and Elisabeth would have all that was beautiful in the religion of the time; devotion towards God; a home of affection and purity; reverence towards all that was sacred in things divine and human; ungrudging, self-denying, loving charity to the poor; the tenderest regard for the feelings of others, so as not to raise a blush, nor to wound their hearts; above all, intense faith and hope in the higher and better future of Israel.\"\n— Edersheim I:136 Note Lk 1:39 – Zacharias \u0026 Elizabeth lived in “a city of Judah” in “the hill country” (Lk 1:39). Identified today as Ain Karim, part of modern Jerusalem (c. 4m \u003e Jaffa Gate), with large “Church of the Visitation.”\nThe angelic announcement to Zacharias (Lk 1:8-17)\nZacharias was fulfilling his duties as a priest, pouring the oblation over the altar of incense in the holy place as part of the “morning offering” – thus the “hour of prayer” for the people (Lk 1:10).\nNote Note that this was a very honorific duty, available only once in a lifetime; thus, this was a remarkably special day in the life of Zacharias the priest.\nAn angel appeared and announced the birth of a son to Zacharias and Elizabeth; because of his incredulity, Zacharias was rebuked and struck dumb until the birth of his child.\nNotice the substance of the angel’s announcement concerning the character and work of the promised son (Lk 1:15-17).\nHe was to be a lifetime Nazarite (Lk 1:15).\nThe child would be “filled with the Holy Spirit from his mother’s womb” (Lk 1:15).\nHe was to turn many Israelites to God (Lk 1:16); indeed, he was to come in fulfillment of the promise made by Malachi concerning the forerunner of Messiah (Lk 1:17).\nTip Was John the Baptist Elijah?\nThe narrative of the birth of John the Baptist (Lk 1:57-80) Caution Harmony Event #2 The birth results in great rejoicing among Elisabeth and her friends (Lk 1:57-58; cf. Lk 1:65)\nThe circumcision \u0026 naming of the child (Lk 1:59-66)\nTip Why is the male child named on the day of his circumcision?\nThe \"Benedictus\" — Zacharias' song of praise (Lk 1:67-79)\nNote Note the theological \u0026 eschatological insights reflected in this song!\nThe maturing years of John are surveyed only briefly in Lk 1:80.\nThe birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ-child\nThe announcement to Mary (Lk 1:26-56) Caution Harmony Event #3 The time (relative to the pregnancy of Mary’s “kinswoman” – KJV: “cousin”, Elizabeth)\nThe place – Nazareth of Galilee\nTip Why were these Judahite Davidic families living in Nazareth/Galilee rather than in Bethlehem?\nConcerning Mary\nHer age and social status\nShe was \"betrothed\" (KJV, \"espoused\") to Joseph\nTip Q: What of Joseph’s age \u0026 previous marital status?\nConcerning the actual announcement to Mary (Lk 1:28-33). Notice how this angelic announcement parallels Old Testament prophecy concerning Messiah:\nThe Old Testament Prophecy The Announcement to Mary \"a virgin shall conceive\" (Isa 7:14)\n\"conceive in thy womb…​never known a man\" (Lk 1:31)\n\"bear a son\" (Isa 7:14)\n\"shall bring forth a son\" (Lk 1:31)\n\"call His name Immanuel\" (Isa 7:14); \"He will come and save you\" (Isa 35:4)\n\"shall call His name Jesus\" (Lk 1:31)\n\"Great is the Lord\" (1 Chron 16:25)\n\"He shall be great\" (Lk 1:32)\n“the LORD whom ye seek shall suddenly come” (Mal 3:1)\n\"…​called, the Son of the Highest\" (Lk 1:32)\n\"the throne of David\" (Isa 9:7)\n\"the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David\" (Lk 1:32)\n\"David my servant shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd\" (Ez 37:24)\n\"He shall reign over the house of Jacob\" (Lk 1:33)\nMary’s question (Lk 1:34-38) is not asked because of unbelief, but because of bewilderment and confusion.\nThe visit of Mary to the home of Elisabeth (Lk 1:39-45)\nThe \"Magnificat\" of Mary (Lk 1:46-56)\nNote Again, note the remarkable theological \u0026 Scriptural maturity and insights reflected in Mary’s song! Compare this song to that of Hannah in 1 Sam 2:1-10.\nThe announcement to Joseph (Mt 1:18-25) Caution Harmony Event #4 Re: the perceived “discrepancies” in the nativity narratives of Matthew \u0026 Luke\nMt 1:19 – Then Joseph her husband, being a just man…” – “because of” or “in spite of”?\nMt 1:20 – What does it mean to “take Mary [as] your wife”? (cf. Mt 1:19 – “her husband”) Cf. Mt 1:24 – “took to him his wife”\nMt 1:21 – “You shall call his name Jesus” – The significance of Joseph’s naming the child.\nThe parents' journey to Bethlehem: the nativity of the God-man (Lk 2:1-7) Caution Harmony Event #6 Why did Joseph take Mary to Bethlehem?\nHow long and arduous was this journey?\nRegarding the enrollment described in Lk 2:1-3\nNote A historical difficulty: how to reconcile this enrollment with Roman historical records:\nQ. 1 – the reference to Quirinius governing Syria\nQ. 2 – When was this census demanded?\nQ. 3 – Why were people required to register in their home towns?\n\"To the devout mind, the enrollment under Augustus looms as one of the clearest indications in all history of the providential control of human affairs by an almighty hand. It is impressive to see how the administrative machinery of a vast empire was set in motion to fulfill the purpose of God in the advent of His Son.\"\n— Harrison 40 Concerning the circumstances of Jesus' birth:\nThe year -\nThe time of year -\nThe place -\nThe birth of the Saviour was the most humble of all births.\nThe worship of the shepherds (Lk 2:8-20) Caution Harmony Event #7 The circumcision of Jesus (Lk 2:21) Caution Harmony Event #8 Presentation of the Child in the Temple; homage paid by Anna and Simeon (Lk 2:22-39) Caution Harmony Event #9 The ritual of purification (Lev 12:2-8) and redemption (Ex 13:2, 12, 15; Num 3:13) (2:22-24)\nThe encounter with Simeon (2:25-35)\nThe encounter with Anna (2:36-39)\nThe visit of the wise-men (Mt 2:1-12) Caution Harmony Event #10 There are a number of fascinating questions here, to wit:\nWho were these \"wise men\"?\nFrom what country had they come?\nHow many \"wise men\" were there?\nWhen did they come to Bethlehem?\nHow did they know that a king had been born?\nWhat was the star that had alerted and then guided them?\nNotice the treachery of Herod (Mt 2:3-8)\nThe important matter in this narrative: Gentile wise-men, probably rulers from Eastern countries, travel to Palestine to pay homage to this new-born child, whom they acknowledge as a king worthy of their worship.\nThe family’s flight to Egypt; the children of Bethlehem slaughtered; the family returns to settle in Nazareth (Mt 2:13-23) Caution Harmony Event #11 Warned by God in a dream, Joseph flees with the family to Egypt (Mt 2:13-15) Notice the quotation from Hosea 11:1, found in Mt 2:15.\nHerod devises another, more sinister scheme to destroy this \"rival\" king (Mt 2:16-18) Notice the quotation from Jer 31:15, found in Mt 2:17,18.\nAt Herod’s death, Joseph is instructed to return; he settles in Galilee, in the city of Nazareth (Mt 2:19-23) Notice the quotation in Mt 2:23.\nThe genealogies of Jesus (Mt 1:1-17; Lk 3:23-28) Caution Harmony Event #5 The PURPOSE of these genealogies—​to connect Jesus by LEGAL and PHYSICAL descent with three ideas of Old Testament promise, and thus validate His claim to be the promised Messiah.\nNote See Appendix 1.2A for a brief comparison of the two genealogies. See R. Larry Overstreet, “Difficulties of New Testament Genealogies” for a helpful and dependable comprehensive consideration of the issue.\nMessiah must be the seed of WOMAN – Genesis 3:15\nMessiah must be the seed of ABRAHAM – Genesis 12:1-3\nMessiah must be the seed of DAVID – 2 Samuel 17 (Psalm 89)\nThe DISTINCTION between the two genealogies\nMATTHEW’S genealogy—​the legal lineage of Jesus, establishing His right to the throne of David\nJesus was NOT the physical son of Joseph, but when Joseph married Mary, Jesus became the legal son of Joseph, and thus the possessor of all that belonged to Joseph’s offspring\nConcerning the word \"begat\" in this genealogy-\nLUKE’S genealogy—​the physical lineage of Jesus, establishing His relationship to the house of David\nNote Note: concerning Lk 3:23—​is this the line of Joseph or of Mary?\nTaken together, these genealogies prove Jesus' right to be the Messiah\nJesus' childhood in Nazareth (Mt 2:23; Lk 2:39, 40) Caution Harmony Event #12 These are called \"the silent years,\" because there is no mention of any events during these years except Lk 2:41-52, the visit to the Temple at the age of 12.\n\"But how different is the boy Christ of the New Testament Apocrypha! He is mischievous, petulant, forward, revengeful. Some of the marvels told of Him are simply aimless and puerile—​as when He carries spilt water in His robe; or pulls the short board to the requisite length; or moulds sparrows of clay, and then claps His hand to make them fly; or throws all the cloths into the dyer’s vat, and then draws them out each stained the requisite colour. But some are, on the contrary, simply distasteful and inconsiderate, as when He vexes and shames and silences those who wish to teach Him; or rebukes Joseph; or turns His playmates into kids; and others are simply cruel and blasphemous, as when He strikes dead with a curse the boys who offend or run against Him until at last there is a storm of popular indignation, and Mary is afraid to let Him leave the house.\"\n— Farrar 46 The homelife of Jesus\nThe earthly family of Jesus\nJoseph—​hard working; of noble character and disposition; provided a comfortable life for his family; working artisan (τέκτων – Mt 13.55, Mk 6:3)\nMary—​very godly, humble, with a loving character and disposition; a student of the Scriptures; a fond and sensitive mother\nJesus' brothers and sisters (Luke 2:7; Mt 13:55, 56) See Appendix 1.2B re: the reputed bone-box of Jesus’ brother, James.\nNote Note: Jesus' brothers rejected Him until after His resurrection (Jn 7:2)\nHis boyhood: happy, comfortable, busy; normal, but unique\nJesus' education\nThe importance of education among the Jews\n\"A father had as well bury his son as neglect his instruction.\"\n— R. Salome \"Our ground is good, and we work it to the utmost; but our chief ambition is for the nurture of our children.\"\n— Josephus Early education in the home\nthe education of a Jewish lad began very young, at the knee of his mother\n3 chief means of teaching in the home:\nCareful, personal instruction\nOrnaments/decoration of the home\nFeast seasons\n\". . . the festive illumination of the house during a week in midwinter in commemoration of the Dedication of the Temple by Judas the Maccabee; the feast of Purim, in celebration of the deliverance through Esther; the feast of the Passover, setting forth the visit of the Death Angel and Israel’s going out from Egypt; followed by the Fast of the Day of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles, with its strange leafy booth; all were calculated to impress the childish mind.\"\n— Shepherd 49 At the age of 5 or 6, Jesus would have begun his formal training at the \"house of the book\" (beit midrash)\nJesus was also trained in a trade - that of an artisan (τέκτων) See Appendix 1.2C re: the occupation of Joseph and thus of Jesus (and His half-brothers)\nThe end of Jesus' childhood and the years at Nazareth (Lk 2:41-52) Caution Harmony Event #13 The significance of this event in the life of Jesus\nAt about the age of 12 a Jewish boy becomes a \"son of the law,\" and is admitted to the privileges of adulthood in the religion and society of Israel\nNote Note re: the concept of “son” in the culture of Judaism:\nOne very important privilege vouchsafed him at this time:\n\"It was probably in AD 8 [sic] that Jesus, twelve years old the previous summer, joined with Joseph and Mary the train of pilgrims travelling southward to Jerusalem to keep that sacred feast which year by year in the month of April was celebrated in commemoration of Israel’s deliverance from her bondage in Egypt. . . He had longed for the day when He should go thither and see it all with His won eyes; and now at length His desire is fulfilled. The week of sacred solemnity was like a wondrous dream to the Holy Child. He would feast His eyes on the impressive pageant and drink in all that He heard.\"\n— Smith 22 Jesus' interview with the Rabbis\nJesus is left behind in the city, His parents return to find Him; meanwhile, Jesus communes with the rabbis\nJesus’ parents return, Mary questions the Boy, the Spirit uses that to bring Him to understand that it is 1) “Why did you seek me?” 2) “Father’s business” or “house of my Father”??\nJesus returns with His parents to Nazareth, and there lives in quiet seclusion and subjection for almost two decades (2:51-52)\n",

<p>Concerning the arrangement of the priests in the days of Jesus:</p>

<p>The tribe of Levi was granted the priestly office (Dt 33:11). All the sons of Levi were to be workers in the temple, but only one family – the sons of Aaron – were to function in the tabernacle/temple as priests, ministering in the Levitical rituals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning the historic lineage of the priestly family:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two of Aaron’s sons were devoured for idolatry (Num 10:1-7); from his 2 surviving sons (Eleazar &amp; Ithamar) had come 24 families; David, denied the privilege of building a temple for King Yahweh, spent the final years of his life arranging the temple services and personnel, including distributing the temple duties among these families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Israel returned from Babylon, the priests had divided themselves into 24 orders; they alternated in performing the priestly office at Jerusalem, functioning in that capacity approximately twice a year. The balance of the year they lived in locations scattered around the land (reminiscent of the 48 “priestly cities” of the OT theocracy).</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#34;But how different is the boy Christ of the New Testament Apocrypha!  He is mischievous, petulant, forward, revengeful.  Some of the marvels told of Him are simply aimless and puerile—​as when He carries spilt water in His robe; or pulls the short board to the requisite length; or moulds sparrows of clay, and then claps His hand to make them fly; or throws all the cloths into the dyer’s vat, and then draws them out each stained the requisite colour.  But some are, on the contrary, simply distasteful and inconsiderate, as when He vexes and shames and silences those who wish to teach Him; or rebukes Joseph; or turns His playmates into kids; and others are simply cruel and blasphemous, as when He strikes dead with a curse the boys who offend or run against Him until at last there is a storm of popular indignation, and Mary is afraid to let Him leave the house.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It was probably in AD 8 [sic] that Jesus, twelve years old the previous summer, joined with Joseph and Mary the train of pilgrims travelling southward to Jerusalem to keep that sacred feast which year by year in the month of April was celebrated in commemoration of Israel’s deliverance from her bondage in Egypt. . . He had longed for the day when He should go thither and see it all with His won eyes; and now at length His desire is fulfilled. The week of sacred solemnity was like a wondrous dream to the Holy Child.  He would feast His eyes on the impressive pageant and drink in all that He heard.&#34;</p>
