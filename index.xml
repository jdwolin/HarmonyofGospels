Note Note: Distinguish this man from others named &amp;#34;John&amp;#34; in the Gospels, especially from John the son of Zebedee, author of the 4th Gospel.
John the Baptizer is now to commence his ministry as forerunner of the Messiah; the Gospel records have been silent concerning him since the time of his supernaturally enabled birth.</description>
